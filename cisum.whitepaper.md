- `low efficiency`: music and arts have no borders while web2 created so many borders amongst them, leading to infficiency in payment, transactions and settlement... etc critical tasks as well as failure to reach out worldwide audiences without borders.
- `loosly maintained fairness`: centralized platforms maximize their profits by often scarificing the interests of artists and fans whilest in general slow down the overall development of the whole industry.
