`Cisum Verse White Paper`

# Cisum Verse
**Revolutionizing the Music & Arts Industry with Web3**


# Introduction

Music and the arts are foundational to human civilization, yet the industry suffers from longstanding challenges deeply rooted in traditional and Web2 structures:

- `Centralization`: Data and assets are controlled by centralized platforms, resulting in concentrated power, manipulation, and high fees for creators and fans.
- `Lack of Transparency`: Opaque data flows and restricted access to information about asset ownership and value growth often lead to users' and creators' interests being compromised.
- `Low Efficiency`: Web2 architectures impose excessive borders, hindering payment, settlement, and global reach for both artists and audiences.
- `Inequitable Value Distribution`: Major intermediaries maximize their profits at the expense of creators and fans, stifling innovation and sustainability across the industry.


# Vision

We, at Cisum Verse, envision a borderless, transparent, and equitable ecosystem for music and the arts, powered by Web3 technology. By leveraging blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized governance, we return power to creators and communities â€” unlocking a sustainable, vibrant, and collaborative future.

Cisum Verse is a pioneering platform dedicated to nurturing emerging artists into fully-fledged stars by leveraging Web3 technologies to connect them with their rapidly growing fan communities.

# Tokenomics

Cisum Verse employs a two-level token model for the entire ecosystems:
- Level-1: `CISUM` token as the unique platform token to power the continuous development of the ecosystem
- Level-2: Credit tokens (codename as `xSTAR`) for Artists or projects to encourange fans engaging activities. `xSTAR` can be used in many artisits or projects actvities ranging from buying artist live-show tickets to swag products like bags/cups/shirts...etc, to NFT items, to taking photos or having dinner with the artisits...to just name a few.

Below shows the high-level diagram of interaction flows between artists, fans and the platform with exhibition of various mining mechanisms:

# Technology

## Employment of Blockchain technology

FullOn Network has been selected as the application platform by Cisum Verse for its ultra-low gas fee and high performance and unique goal of being the application chain to all other chains by its powerful built-in interoperbility.

## Employment of Smart contract technology

| Category           | Contract name    | Usage description |
|--------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| `CISUM` tokens     | `cisum.token`    | issuing `CISUM` tokens |
| `CISUM` vesting control | `flon.vest` | vesting and linear unlock `CISUM` tokens |
| `xSTAR` tokens     | `xstar.cisum`    | issuing `xSTAR` credit NFT tokens for artists/projects |
| NFT tokens         | `cisum.ntoken`   | issuing NFT tokens for Cisum ecosystem |
| `CISUM` sales      | `sales.cisum`    | sales of `CISUM` tokens minted from artisits reserve |
| `CISUM/USDT` Swap  | `flon.swap`      | Swap Pool DEX |
| `PoH` mining pool  | `poh.cisum`      | mine `CISUM` tokens with new account joining/following the artists groups |
| `PoS` mining pool  | `pos.cisum`      | mine `CISUM` tokens as interests for staking `CISUM` tokens into the pool |
| `PoP` mining pool  | `pop.cisum`      | mine `CISUM` tokens as rewards to buyers who buy products/services/contents within the platform |
| `PoE` mining pool  | `poe.cisum`      | mine `xSTAR` credit NFT tokens with on-chain activities |

```
Note: For off-chain PoE mining activities users will be airdropped with xSTAR credit tokens directly by the platform instead of going through the PoE smart contract for token issuance.
